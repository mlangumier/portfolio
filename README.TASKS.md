# Organisation

This file is a way to organise the developpement process and regroup some useful links and tips that are used throughout the project. Some tools like Notion, Jira or Trello are much more efficient at doing this, but the goal here is not to be precise and have a strict organisation, but to have an overview of the project that is easily accesible while working on it.

## Tips & inspirations

These are some of the tools, websites and templates I have used or taken inspiration from to develop this website:

- [Color palettes](https://coolors.co/34a1bc-2f819a-145169-0b2c3e-ffeb34-ffc229-d9990d-ad8226)
- [Design by Maya Nelson](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2622?originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%2Fhtml%2Fportfolio-cv&tpClick=view_button&esi=bab18c59-35d9-412d-986c-991e8416c5c8)

## Ideas:

These pages - if implemented - might need different layouts: 

- [x] Portfolio: Main pages, static
- [ ] Blog posts page (+ API)
- [ ] Movie library (+ API)
- [ ] Admin dashboard (+ DB)
