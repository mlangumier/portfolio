# PROJECT ORGANISATION

This file is a way to organise the developpement process and regroup some useful links and tips that are used throughout the project. Some tools like Notion, Jira or Trello are much more efficient at doing this, but the goal here is not to be precise and have a strict organisation, but to have an overview of the project that is easily accesible while working on it.

## INSPIRATIONS

These are some designs I have taken inspiration from:

## ROADMAP - TODO

  - [x] Optimize FCP/LCP
  - [x] Add tailwind-merge and the function to work with clsx

#### Animation & interaction

Now that our page is looking much better, we're going to add some animations and interaction, to better improve the user experience, and display more interesting skills.

- [x] Skills section:

  - [x] Card animations: Slide-in from bottom with fade-in while appearing.
  - [x] Delay the animation on desktop so the cards don't appear all at once.
  - [x] Make sure the animation only happens once: the cards stay after appearing.

- [x] Experience section:

  - [x] Card animations: slide-in from side with fade-in while appearing.
  - [x] Timeline: make the line & circles change color or appear with scroll.

- [ ] Contact section:

  - [ ] Setup form validation with Zod
  - [ ] Setup email sender
  - [ ] (?) Setup Google Re-Captcha
  - [ ] (?) Send confirmation email when message is received?

## ROADMAP - DONE

### Initialisation

## FIXES & UPDATES

Not linked to any roadmap, to do when relevant or if necessary.

- [ ] Markdown - Update files & formatting, add table of contents (cf. extension)
- [ ] Theme - Setup dark mode integration (+ colored themes?)
- [ ] Component - Change language switcher to a `Select` component (if theme switcher is onClick)
- [ ] Component - Add a scroll-to-top button
- [ ] Architecture - Use `FSD` ([Feature-Slided Design](https://feature-sliced.design/docs/guides/tech/with-nextjs#app-router)) for better clarity & scaling
- [ ] Routes - Upon adding new pages, reorganise routes (& reorganize `/data` & `/utils`)
- [ ] Internationalization - Separate dictionaries in multiple files when starting projects
- [ ] Internationalization - Add translations for accessibility & common items (links, buttons)
- [ ] Theme - When creating project, check if relevant to use style files (.css + tailwind.config.ts) specific to the project's route to override generic style (layout, component, fonts etc.).

## FUTURE ROADMAP & IDEAS

### Pages

- **About me**: more in-depath and personnal introduction
- **Contact**: contact form on its own page
- **Projects**: overview of projets available on this website (when multiple projects added), with a tag filter (can select techs, frameworks, deps).

### Potential projects

- Project Manager
- Interactive Dashboard
- D&D Character Creator
- Mini-game

#### 1. Project Task Manager

(This project would replace this file)

Would be similar to Notion and Jira, but with basic features (inspired by [Aurora Sharff's demo at Next.js Conf 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvAySC5ex9c)).

**Objective**: have a better task management interface for this project, allow other people to suggest changes. Later, perhaps allow for other people to create & manage their own projects and tasks.

**Skills & tools**: form validation, CRUD/services + database, authentication, user permissions, admin dashboard with notifications, drag-n-drop, data fetching optimization (get a lot of data, perhaps images)

**Features**: visitors can view the project, users can suggest modifications (which will appear on their view after that), admins can edit the project management page, view and compare the suggested changes (similar to versionning tools).

#### 2. Interactive Dashboard

Dashboard showing statistics about dev languages & tech:

**Skills & tools**: forms validation, CRUD/services + database, public API fetch (optional), diagrams display (library), specific UI style (ex: neon?), dark mode

**Features**: Allows the user to answer to a poll, then display results of all users answers, using different types of interactive diagrams (use data from this website only, but can compare to other polls if APIs available)
